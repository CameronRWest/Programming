## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to explore and gain knowledge about object oriented design with Java. 
I chose to recreate an older game mechanic, as it would allow me to focus on the OOP aspect more. 

Each folder describes and shows snips of code pertaining to different areas of a Java application. 




Not everything is show or added here, just some of important bits to show understanding.
