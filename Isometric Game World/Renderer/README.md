# Renderer
This is used to transfer the flat tile map to a layer of terrain blocks to give the illusion of a 3d landscape. 
You can see in the image terrainMap what a tile map might look like. Each tile has a corresponding block, or set of blocks. 

Then in the block_example, you'll see that the Renderer is drawing out each tile in the map as a terrain block. 
It also gives them a layer so that we can overlap entites and objects within the world space.
